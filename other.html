        <img src = "images/beigeportrait.jpg" alt = "Portrait of a woman against a 
        beige background. Black and red paint is dry-brushed on." width = 200/>
        <p>I used acrylic, pen, and newspaper to create this mixed media piece. 
            I used stippling to shade, which proved to be 
            time-consuming and challenging. I kept the shading rather minimal, as I 
            wanted the face to stand out against the darker newspaper and black paint 
            brush strokes, which were dry-brushed on.</p>
        <img src = "images/emptyhead.jpg" alt = "Ink drawing of two girls. One head is empty, 
        instead being lined by concentric circles in the middle." width = 200/>
        <p>I wanted to create something surreal with ink. I used a stippling technique to shade the piece. 
            I created this piece to talk about the pressures to conform. 
            People, especially women, are often urged to look a certain way and act a certain way. 
            It's a strange back-and-forth, "too much or too little" conversation that proves fruitless. </p>
        <img src = "images/bipolar.jpg" alt = "Ink drwaing of two heads. One is lying on top of 
        the other, upuside-down, and is connected." width = 200/>
        <img src = "images/home.jpg" alt = "A pastel acrylic drawing of a cartoon home. Black 
        puffy paint is used for linework." width = 200/>
        <p> For this, I wanted to make something a little more kitschy: 
            something you might be able to see hanging up inside a house. 
            For this reason, I used acrylic to paint solid, pastel colored 
            shapes and black puffy paint to outline and create small shadows.</p>
        <img src = "images/mlk.jpg" alt = "A realism drawing of Martin Luther King Jr. using pencil." width = 200/>
        <p>I drew this realism portrait of Martin Luther King Jr. using pencil as a practice 
            of technical skills. It was a labor-heavy, arduous process.</p>
        <img src = "images/news.jpg" alt = "An oil pastel drawing of multiple eyes. Cutouts 
        of newspaper are pasted over the top." width = 200/>
        <img src = "images/robot.jpg" alt = "A colored pencil drawing of a blue robot." width = 200/>
        <img src = "images/spies.jpg" alt = "A multi-media piece of a woman. Foam board is used 
        for the back with a paint drip over the top. Another foam board is used for the woman. 
        Copper wires are pasted over the top." width = 200/>
        <img src = "images/wolfmother.jpg" alt = "A scratchboard drawing of a woman with a wolf head." width = 200/>
        <img src = "images/wolfparent.jpg" alt = "A pencil and ink drawing of two humanoids with wolf heads 
        holding an infant with a pig head." width = 200/>
